Assignment 7, CS 2240, Spring 2016
Web Server 
Due at Final Exam -- 5pm Tuesday. 

For this last assignment you will build some minimal web server. The general specifications are:

1) The server can handle multiple clients using threads

2) The server can manage GET Http requests and serve image and audio files. 

3) A 'thread pool' that allows threads to handle multiple requests will be used. 

Obviously 1) and 2) should be done before 3.

The Unix system calls you build with are those that allow a 'socket' to be created for something you might think of as a networked pipe. On top of this flow of data you must implement the simplest HTTP protocol so that GET requests can be managed. 

There are utilities that we can use to profile your server. I haven't recalled what we have used previously but I will get that identified so that you can 'profile' your server's performance. Colin tells me that a program called Siege can be used to test the DDOS defenses. 

You have been given simple socket examples as well as a skeleton for the thread pool. Server2.c apparently has a bug.
