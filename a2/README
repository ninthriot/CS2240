Assignment 2 -- Directory Traversal
Push your work to the a2 repo for cs2240 by Tuesday, February 9.

You are to write a program called as 
	$./a.out <dir>
where the supplied parameter is a directory name. 
That name may be an absolute or relative path and need not reside in the same directory as a.out
The program should print the file names in that directory and all directories below. This should be done in a recursive (depth first) fashion, indenting as the directory depth increases. 
If permissions for file names or directories are denied recover gracefully. 
In addition, if any 'core' files are discovered, remove them if possible. 
System calls that may be appropriate include the 'stat' functions, chdir(), getcwd(), and the macros that identify the file type, given the mode of a file. 
Format your output legibly so that the reader can know what the traversal has done. Recover gracefully from errors. 
Be sure you not follow links or directories '.' and '..'
